## Happy Wheels Unblocked: A Rollercoaster Ride of Pain and Laughter

The internet is a vast playground, filled with games catering to every taste. But few games offer a truly unique, chaotic, and strangely addictive experience like **Happy Wheels Unblocked**. This browser-based game, renowned for its absurd physics and gruesome visuals, has become a cult classic, drawing in millions of players worldwide. 

**What is Happy Wheels Unblocked?**

In essence, Happy Wheels is a physics-based platformer where you control a series of increasingly bizarre characters. From the classic "Man" with his trusty wheelchair to the bizarre "Segway Guy" and the terrifying "Cyborg," each character has unique abilities and weaknesses. The goal?
